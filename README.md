# RPS-Bot

## About
A simple rock paper scissors bot tournament originally developed for a friendly programming club competition. This rock paper scissors repository contains a set of utilities that allows people to pit their rock paper scissor bots against each other.

## Running Requirements
- Have Java JDK
- Have a Java IDE
- Know how to use a computer

## Contributing

This project welcomes you to submit your own bot, you can run your bot against an existing bot and see who will win.

We ask that **before you start work on a bot that you would like to contribute**, please read our [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). We do not want any purely random bots as that would defeat the point of the competition.

## What's Happening
This project is not being actively maintained, but if you submit a PR with a bot, it is likely to be merged. Have fun!
